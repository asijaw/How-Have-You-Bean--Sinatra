# How've You Bean?

The coffee journal app to track your favorite coffees and share them with your friends. Built with Ruby, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, etc. 

With *How've You Bean?* you can create an account, track your coffees, and view all coffees that have been shared by others. 

Your coffees page is automatically sorted in descending rating order, so your favorites will always be at the top, where you need them. 

## To run this app

Run `bundle install` then run `shotgun` and navigate to the appropriate local address. 

*This app is not currently deployed because I haven't dealt with setting up the database on an actual server.*
